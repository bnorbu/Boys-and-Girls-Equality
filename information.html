    The unequal treatment of boys and girls remains a widespread issue rooted in cultural norms, societal expectations, and systemic biases. Girls often face limited access to education, stricter household responsibilities, and fewer career opportunities, while boys may experience pressure to conform to traditional masculine roles. These disparities hinder personal growth and societal progress, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. Promoting gender equality through education, fair policies, and awareness can help ensure that boys and girls are treated with equal respect and opportunities, allowing them to reach their full potential.</h1>
