    <h1>If boys and girls are not treated equally, we can promote equality by educating children about fairness and respect from an early age. Parents and teachers should ensure both boys and girls have equal opportunities to pursue their interests and responsibilities. Governments should implement laws to protect against gender discrimination and promote equal rights. Awareness campaigns can challenge harmful stereotypes and inspire change. Together, these efforts can create a society where everyone is treated with fairness and dignity.</h1>
